LinkTunes.AdiumScripts
======================
A simple Adium script that substitutes a link to the currently playing song in
iTunes.

Run 'rake' after cloning this into your Adium scripts directory - you have to
compile the AppleScript before it will be recognized by Adium (unfortunately).

You'll probably need to edit this before putting it on your own machine,
there's not a lot of way to offer 'configuration' for Adium scripts.
